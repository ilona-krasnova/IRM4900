                    <p>We want to keep you safe. We don't try to get any personal info from you. When you send us something to make shorter, we only 
                        use it to help create the summary. We ask you not to send us anything private because we can't make sure it stays secret. If 
                        by accident you send us something personal, we won't keep it or use it for anything else. We work hard to keep our system safe, 
                        but we can't promise that everything you share with us will stay private since other people might see it. It's your job to make sure that 
                        what you send us isn't secret or something that belongs to someone else.
