Simple:
There's a man named Ralph who's really good at finding his way around without needing a map or GPS. He learned this from playing a game called orienteering when he was a little boy, where he would race to find places with just a map and a compass. Some people are better at finding their way because they played outside a lot when they were kids, or they grew up in places with lots of different paths and areas. Boys and girls can be equally good at finding their way, but sometimes girls don't get as many chances to practice. Our brains have special parts that help us remember places and know which way to go. Even grown-ups can get better at this if they practice by paying attention to things like the sun and the wind when they walk around. It's also important to not be scared of getting a little lost sometimes because that's how we learn. Playing games outside, like orienteering or even just walking in new ways, can make us really good at finding our way, even when we're older. 

Medium:
Ralph Street is really good at finding his way around without a map or GPS because he learned to orienteer when he was a little kid. Orienteering is a sport where you race to find points on a map using a compass. Ralph thinks being good at this can help in everyday life, like when he helped his friends find their way in a new city. Scientists say that people can get better at finding their way around, too. If kids play outside and explore different places, they can grow up to be better at knowing where they're going. Sometimes girls don't get to practice this as much, which is why some people think guys are better at it. But that's not really true; it's just that girls often don't get as many chances to learn. Your brain has a special part that helps with remembering places and finding your way. Even adults can get better at this if they try. You can practice by paying attention to things like the sun and the wind, or by joining a club that does orienteering. And it's okay to get a little lost sometimesâ€”it actually helps you learn! So, even if you use your phone to find places, you can still become a great navigator if you keep exploring and trying new things.

Complex:
Ralph Street grew up loving maps and orienteering, which means finding your way from one place to another using a map and compass. He got really good at it because he started young and practiced a lot. Scientists say that when kids explore different places by themselves, they get better at finding their way around. If girls and women don't get as many chances to practice, they might not feel as confident, but it's not because they're naturally worse at it. People who live in the countryside or in twisty, turny cities are usually better at navigating. It's important to go to different places, not just back and forth to the same spot every day. Your brain has a special part called the hippocampus that helps you remember where to go, and it can get better with practice. Scientists have found out that even adults can improve their navigation skills, which is great because you can't always rely on your phone's GPS. To get better at finding your way, pay attention to things like the sun and the wind, and don't be afraid to explore new places. Practice makes perfect, and it's never too late to start learning how to navigate better!
