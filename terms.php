                    <h2>Summary for children</h2>
                        <p>Our project is like a special helper that takes big, grown-up writing and makes it easier to understand for 
                            young friends like you. When you use our helper, you agree to play by the rules. This means you can't break 
                            it or bother other people using it. You can't sneak into places you're not supposed to go, and you can't bring 
                            in yucky computer bugs. If you give us a story to make simple, you have to make sure it's okay to share it. When 
                            we make it simple, that new, easy story belongs to us, but the big story still belongs to the person who wrote it. 
                            You can't take the easy story and pretend it's yours. If something goes wrong while you're using the helper, we're 
                            really sorry, but we can't fix everything. If you're ever confused or have questions, it's okay to <a href="contact.php">ask us for help</a>!

                            <p>Welcome to our student project (the "Project") which creates summaries of complex texts for children. This Project

                                and potentially by occasional users who discover it online.
